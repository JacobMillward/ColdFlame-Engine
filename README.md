# Coldflame Engine
 By Jacob Millward

This is a component-driven engine written in C#. It isn't yet completed, so use at your own risk.

Based off of:

[SFML.NET](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/) - .NET bindings to SFML

[Entity-System](https://github.com/JacobMillward/Entity-System/) - My previous experiment in Java
