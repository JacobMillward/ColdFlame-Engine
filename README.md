# Coldflame Engine
By Jacob Millward

This is a component-driven engine written in C#. It isn't yet completed, so use at your own risk.

Based off of [SFML.NET](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml.net/) - .NET bindings to SFML

Comes with an example project to show you how to use the current features of the library.
